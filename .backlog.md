## Keyboard simulation

Currently it does not work over
[SSH](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard/issues/195)

- https://github.com/moses-palmer/pynput
- https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard

## Binary encoding

See the initial setup in the yaml file,
this needs to be expanded.

## Bluetooth HID

Appear as
[bluetooth](https://people.csail.mit.edu/albert/bluez-intro/c212.html)
keyboard
([HID](https://github.com/007durgesh219/BTGamepad))
to devices


## Matrix optimization

The code currently uses a very basic approach of reading out the inputs,
maybe this can be optimized/pin numbers can be reduced.
Do we want a diode in the schema?
